# Generative_Z2O

### Gen AI - How is it different from Tranditional AI and whats new?

There are two fundamental approches of AI, 

##### Discriminative AI and Generative AI. 

##### Discriminative AI
- Discriminative AI is distinguishes between different classes of data or predicts futures data points. Ideally they perform Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive and Prescriptive tasks.

- A discriminative AI model needs training data with labeled or unlabeled data points. 

- Now model builds the ability to predicts the class of a new data point or predict the new data point itself by analysing the decision boundary. 

- Moreover Discriminative AI models use advanced algorithms to differentiate, classify, identify patterns, and draw conclusions based on training data. 

An example : how email spam filters can differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.

- Discriminative AI can answer questions like is this image a drawing of a nest or an egg? What is the expected sales of a particular product given the past sales.

##### Genarative AI
- Generative AI would respond to prompts, such as draw an image of a nest with three eggs in it.

- Even though both discriminative and generative models are created using deep learning techniques, Generative AI derives the multimodal data where as Genrative AI predicts or prescribes the data.

- The creative skills of generative AI come from generative AI models, like: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, transformers, and diffusion models.
