### Gen AI Basics for all

GenAI
* Type of machine learning
* learn deep patterns
* multimodal
* Generate creative new variants inspired by original

Classical ML
* Predictions about similar data

Generative AI
* generate more data with similar patterns and relationshipd



Benefits of GenAI
* Boost in creativity
* Improved productivity
* Automation of Task
* Cost optimization
* Reduce human efforts in repetitive tasks

1986 - Auto-encoder

Whats new with GenAI
* Larger models
* Easily Accessible
* Chat interface
* Boardrooms are noticing

Language models are not knowledge models
* They are premitive
* Higher Accuracy and correctness is not yet there

Key Processes - terms
* Training
* Alignment or  
* Fine Tuning
* Generation
* Ensuring correctness


Risks
* Foundation models are not well understood
* Trust and correctness
* Biased
* Energy consumption
* Intellectual property may be misused
* Possible data leakage
* Privacy risks
* statictical answers are not Ethics & Cultural

GenAI - Assessment
*  - Start
	->Does it matter if its incorrect?
*  -No -> Use it  #END
* -Yes
	->Do you have expertise to correct the output??
* -No -> Not safe to use #END
* -Yes
	->Are you taking full responsiblity?
* -No -> Not safe to use
* -Yes-> Use with caution #END



Myth Busting
* Not new
* There are more than one type
* Not limited to chatbots
* Not actually intelligent
* GenAI is small part of large domain of AI
* Generated contents are not always true



Ethical usage
* Transparent
* Controllable
* Carefully delimit the impact
* Robust and Safe
* Sustainable
* Fair
* -Privacy and Data protection
