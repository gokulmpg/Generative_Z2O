Write me a song about RCB and IPL trophy --  GPT - 4 - Turbo

**Title: Chase for Glory**

(Verse 1)
In the heart of Bangalore, under the floodlights' roar,  
RCB takes the field, with the crowd's mighty cheer.  
Jerseys red and gold, dreams bold and old,  
Chasing the elusive trophy, stories retold.

(Chorus)
Chase for glory, in the game's great story,  
Royal Challengers, write your own history.  
With every ball and bat, where the champions sat,  
Bring home the trophy, we've all been dreaming at.

(Verse 2)
Virat leads the charge, with intentions large,  
Maxwell by his side, they play with pride.  
Harshal's swings and Siraj's seams,  
Together they chase the ultimate of dreams.

(Bridge)
Through ups and downs, the highs and lows,  
The spirit of Bangalore brightly glows.  
Past seasons' echoes, future's close,  
In the garden city, hope forever grows.

(Chorus)
Chase for glory, in the game's great story,  
Royal Challengers, write your own history.  
With every ball and bat, where the champions sat,  
Bring home the trophy, we've all been dreaming at.

(Outro)
So here's to the runs, the wickets, and the plays,  
To the heart-thumping finishes, the unforgettable days.  
RCB, in your quest we believe,  
Lift the trophy high, your legacy achieve.

This song is a tribute to Royal Challengers Bangalore's pursuit of their first IPL trophy, encapsulating the passion of the players and fans alike, and the enduring hope of finally claiming the coveted title.
